/**
 * menger - function that draws a 2D Menger sponge
 * @level: level of recursion
 * Write a function that draws a 2D Menger Sponge

Prototype: void menger(int level);
Where level is the level of the Menger Sponge to draw
If level is lower than 0, your function must do nothing
You’re allowed to use the math library. Your program will be compiled using the ld flag -lm
Format:

First, read Menger sponge
Here, we will only draw a 2D version of the Menger sponge, but the principle is the same
A level N sponge is a 3x3 square of level N-1 sponges, except for the center one, which is left empty
A level 0 sponge is represented by the # character
Examples:
A level 0 sponge is a simple 1x1 square
A level 1 sponge is a 3x3 square of level 0 sponges, except for the center one, which is left empty
A level 2 sponge is a 3x3 square of level 1 sponges, except for the center one, which is left empty
…
TIP: The size of a level N Menger sponge is calculated as follows: 3^N
